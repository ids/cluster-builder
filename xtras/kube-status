Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of control-plane nodes by copying certificate authorities 
and service account keys on each node and then running the following as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.100.200:6443 --token 9aeb42.99b7540a5833866a \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:88facdf1d9162886efb8eb43c90f5c29575d3173f4ea4a463c5c64f4078a51d8 \
    --experimental-control-plane 	  

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.100.200:6443 --token 9aeb42.99b7540a5833866a \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:88facdf1d9162886efb8eb43c90f5c29575d3173f4ea4a463c5c64f4078a51d8
